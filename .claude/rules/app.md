# App-level gotchas (read before touching auth, PDF/print, redirects, or the transcripts API)

- **Hebrew PDF** needs a real browser engine — `react-pdf`/`html2canvas` garble Hebrew next to
  numbers. Proper fix = server-side Playwright `page.pdf()`; current stopgap = `window.print()`
  via `/print/[id]`.
- **Sign-out stays a plain `<a href="/api/auth/signout">`** — a z-index overlap once let
  `<main>` swallow the click on a dropdown. Don't reintroduce a dropdown.
- **Railway redirects** must derive origin from `x-forwarded-host`/`x-forwarded-proto`, never
  `request.url` (resolves to internal `localhost:8080`).
- **PUT /api/transcripts/[id] validation is intentionally lenient** (`.passthrough()`,
  `role: z.string()`) — legacy rows have `role: "unknown"`. Don't tighten to an enum.
- **`/app/*` pages have no hard login gate** (API routes ARE auth-gated) — known gap, flagged
  for a dedicated auth pass before launch. Don't assume pages are protected.
- **Design parity is verified against the RENDERED design, never bundle CSS** (7-round lesson,
  2026-07-14): probe computed styles / canvas `measureText` on the live design page. The design
  uses TWO system stacks — body = SF Pro Text stack (→ Segoe UI on Windows), headlines
  (`fontFamily.head`) = SF Pro Display stack WITHOUT system-ui (→ Arial on Windows). Bundle CSS
  can be a stale iteration of the design.
- **Company-overview extras + Home quarter tag are STUB-FED** (`lib/company/overview-stub.ts`,
  hardcoded "Q2 2026" on Home) — fabricated demo facts on real pages. Must gain demo markers /
  real feeds before launch (FINDINGs filed 2026-07-14).
